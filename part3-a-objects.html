    <h3>The Recipe Card</h3>
    <p>Never forget another recipe!<br>
        - Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings).<br>
        - On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:<br>
        -- Mole<br>
        -- Serves: 2<br>
        -- Ingredients:<br>
        -- cinnamon<br>
        -- cumin<br>
        -- cocoa

    <h3>The Reading List</h3>
        Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!<br>
        - Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).<br>
        - Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".<br>
        - Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
