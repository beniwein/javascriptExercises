<h3>The Fortune Teller</h3>    
<p>Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?<br>
    - Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.<br>
    - Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Age Calculator</h3>
<p>Want to find out how old you'll be? Calculate it!<br>
    - Store your birth year in a variable.<br>
    - Store a future year in a variable.<br>
    - Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.<br>
    - For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what month it is in 2026.<br>
    - Output them to the screen like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the values.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Lifetime Supply Calculator</h3>
<p>Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!<br>
    - Store your current age into a variable.<br>
    - Store a maximum age into a variable.<br>
    - Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).<br>
    - Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.<br>
    - Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Geometrizer</h3>
<p>Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.<br>
    - Store a radius into a variable.<br>
    - Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".<br>
    - Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Temperature Converter</h3>
<p>It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.<br>
    - Store a celsius temperature into a variable.<br>
    - Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".<br>
    - Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.<br>
    - Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."</p>
