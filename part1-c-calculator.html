    <h3>The Calculator</h3>

    - Write a function called squareNumber that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the
    result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."<br>
    - Write a function called halfNumber that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result.
    It should also log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".<br>
    - Write a function called percentOf that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents
    of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."<br>
    - Write a function called areaOfCircle that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that,
    and return the result. It should also log a string like "The area for a circle with radius 2 is
    12.566370614359172."<br>
    <b>-- Bonus:</b> Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.<br>
    - Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions
    you wrote earlier1:<br>
    1. Take half of the number and store the result.<br>
    2. Square the result of #1 and store that result.<br>
    3. Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.<br>
    4. Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).
