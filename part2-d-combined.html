    <h3>Homework: The Word Guesser</h3>
    <p>You'll create a simple word guessing game where the user gets infinite tries to guess the word (like Hangman without the hangman, or like Wheel of Fortune without the wheel and fortune).<br>
        - Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'), and one to hold the current guessed letters (e.g. it would start with '_', '_', '_' and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').<br>
        - Write a function called guessLetter that will:<br>
        -- Take one argument, the guessed letter.<br>
        -- Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.<br>
        -- If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array to reflect that.<br>
        -- When it's done iterating, it should log the current guessed letters ('F__')<br>
        -- and congratulate the user if they found a new letter.<br>
        -- It should also figure out if there are any more letters that need to be guessed,<br> 
        -- and if not, it should congratulate the user for winning the game.<br>
        Pretend you don't know the word, and call guessLetter multiple times with various letters to check that your program works.<br>
        <b>Bonus:</b> Make it more like Wheel of Fortune:<br>
        -- Start with a reward amount of $0<br>
        -- Every time a letter is guessed, generate a random amount and reward the user if they found a letter (multiplying the reward if multiple letters found), otherwise subtract from their reward.<br>
        -- When they guess the word, log their final reward amount.<br>
        <b>Bonus:</b> Make it like Hangman:<br>
        -- Keep track of all the guessed letters (right and wrong) and only let the user guess a letter once. If they guess a letter twice, do nothing.<br>
        -- Keep track of the state of the hangman as a number (starting at 0), and subtract or add to that number every time they make a wrong guess.<br>
        -- Once the number reaches 6 (a reasonable number of body parts for a hangman), inform the user that they lost and show a hangman on the log.</p>
